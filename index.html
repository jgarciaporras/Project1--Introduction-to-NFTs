                    A non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique identifier that can cryptographically assign and prove ownership of digital goods. 
                    As NFTs for digital artwork have sold for millions — sometimes tens of millions — of dollars, to say they're popular could be an undersell. In the first half of 2021, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/cryptocurrencies/nft-value-sales-h1-dappradar-nonfungible-tokens-crypto-hype-2021-7">NFT sales hit $2.5 billion.</a>

                    An interesting project called "LlamaPunkz" has been released a few months ago and has a lot of potencial in NFTs world.

                    Its a project focus on 'the community'. The project will have 0 royalty fee's you heard that correct! What this doesn't mean is that we will abandon our community. We want to bring you a system where you can buy art work without royality fees and gas fees. After launch, it will be giving out rewards and plan on developing a game as well.
                    Their roadmap is the following:
